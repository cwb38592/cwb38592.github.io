<h2>2017 Season...So Far</h2>
    <font color="red">
	The Bulldogs started this season off as favorites to win the SEC East. Florida and Tennessee were not looking very strong for this season so it looked like the Dawgs year to play for an SEC Championship. Georgia won a close game against Notre Dame in week 2 before dominating the rest of the teams on their schedule. That is, until they played Auburn on November 11th. The Bulldogs were beaten badly, 40-17, and did not give much hope to the Bulldog Nation that they would become champions once again. I was in attendance for the Auburn game and I can attest it was the most depressing day of the year so far for a Georgia fan.

<H2>The Rest of the 2017 Season</H2>
</font>
After the Auburn loss, energy is down in Athens. However, there is still hope for the Dawgs to make 2017 a championship year. That path now flows through the newly built Mercedes-Benz dome in Atlanta where Georgia will most likely play mighty Alabama for the SEC championship in December. Alabama will be the toughest test the Dawgs face all year, but if they can find a way to win that game, a spot in the College Football Playoff is almost guranteed. </div>

<h2>National Championship</h2>
<font color="blue">
	A Georgia Bulldogs national championship win would mean the world to me, my family, and all of Athens. My father was a student at UGA the last time the Dawgs won the title in 1982 and he would be thrilled if I could experience a championship as a student as well. The road has been long and there are still tests to come, but with the support of the Bulldog Nation, I believe we can win it all this year. Go Dawgs!
